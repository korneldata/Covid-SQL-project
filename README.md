# Covid-SQL-project
My inspiration for this project was project made by Alex Freberg ("Alex The Analyst"), but I wrote SQL queries on my own.

The objectives of this project were following:
1.	figure out countries with the highest death rate,
2.	establish countries with the highest number of Covid cases compared to country population,
3.	figure out countries with the highest vaccination rate compared to country population,
4.	calculate the number of new vaccinations per day based on total vaccinations in each country.

I used Covid-19 dataset from https://ourworldindata.org.
